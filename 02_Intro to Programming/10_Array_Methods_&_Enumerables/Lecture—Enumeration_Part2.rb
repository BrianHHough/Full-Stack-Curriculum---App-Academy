# range enumerable
#   (start...end).each, iterate from start to end (inclusive)
#   (start...end).each, iterate from start to end (excluding end)


#arr = [1,2,3,4,5]

# prints out every element of the array
# arr.each { |ele| puts ele }                # THE BLOCK


# Cleaner code
#(5...10).each { |num| puts num}      # Each takes in a block of code and iterate through




# Write a method fizzBuzz that takes in a number max and returns an array containing all numbers less than max that are divisible by 3 or 5, but not both
